### Hey, what's up?

I'm Danilo Barros, a Brazilian programmer, computational linguist, educator and communicologist.

Here on my GitHub, I'll be making available some of my knowledges! The best way to learn is to pass the content forward.

I love to think about solutions that involve **all areas of knowledge**, I'm a generalist! Let's promote an effective and efficient education. **Technology must be used _by_ and _for_ everyone**.

### I am currently training:
- Data Science;
- Machine Learning, Deep Learning;
- Whenever possible, I use Python and its libraries.

### Hey, what's up?

I'm Danilo Barros, a Brazilian programmer, computational linguist, educator and communicologist.

Here on my GitHub, I'll be making available some of my knowledges! The best way to learn is to pass the content forward.

## I am currently training my general computer skills:
- HTML, CSS and Javascript (and then I want to learn React)
- Mathematical thinking, algebra and data science
- Machine Learning, Deeplearning

## Contact me if you want to train together or if you want my collaboration!

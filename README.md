### Hey, what's up?

I'm Danilo Barros, a Brazilian data scientist and computational linguist.

Here on my GitHub, I'll be making available some of my knowledges! The best way to learn is to pass the content forward.

### I am currently training **Data Science** and **Machine Learning algorithms**.
You can acess my latest project here in GitHub, or deployed, in the links above:

I love to think about solutions that involve **all areas of knowledge**, I'm a generalist! Let's promote an effective and efficient education. **Technology must be used _by_ and _for_ everyone**.

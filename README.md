### Hey, what's up?

I'm Danilo Barros, a Brazilian programmer, computational linguist, educator and communicologist.

Here on my GitHub, I'll be making available some of my knowledges! The best way to learn is to pass the content forward.

I love to think about solutions that involve **all areas of knowledge**, I'm a generalist! Let's promote an effective and efficient education. **Technology must be used _by_ and _for_ everyone**.

### I am currently training my general computer skills:
- HTML, CSS and Javascript (and then I want to learn React);
- Mathematical thinking, Algebra and Data Science;
- Machine Learning, Deeplearning;
- Whenever possible, I use Python and its libraries.

### Contact me if you want to train together or if you want my collaboration!
